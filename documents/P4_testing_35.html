            <h2>Administrative details</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
            Our client is Kjell-Inge Johansen. He is a friend of Ingvild in the group, and they met playing the Ingress mobile
            game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kjell-Inge is a truck driver, with a growing side business shooting drone footage. He would like a webpage to
            display his cinematic drone videos and images, but also to get more drone shoot commissions.

            <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
            A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
            website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
            your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
            students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
            do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
            well

            <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
        </header>

        <h3>Criticism:</h3>
        <p>
            The menu was at times a little hard to read.
            Some testers also complained that the menu was on the right. One tester asked “where is the menu?” when asked why he didn’t use it.
            Some inconsistencies with example photos. Why are there no examples of houses og property photos in the price section? Customers who want these services want to see examples.
            Inconsistencies in the layout were also pointed out. Link and headings were sometimes confused, as they were styled similarly.
            Users expected that some parts of the site would scroll in full page increments, like it usually does in news features etc. Especially because of the arrow indicating there is more content below.
            A user pointed out frustration with why using shortcuts to navigate back did not close the full screen image viewer.
            Some users were confused as to why there wasn’t functionality to actually pay or order anything on the webpage.
            One user complained that the menu didn’t render well on narrow displays.
        </p>

        <h3>Positive:</h3>

        <p>
            Clients liked the general design of the site and how it showcased the work. It made a positive impression of the drone footage and the work of Kjell-Inge.
            The design looked modern and professional.
            The use of color was also something that stood out among the testers as a positive
            They liked the scrolling format of our index page and the information it offered
            The photos and videos were pointed out as beautiful.
            It was pointed out that the website had a clear purpose and did what it was supposed to do.

            <h2>Our response</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
            We could make the site more readable by making the font size larger for people with bad eyesight. The issues of not having relevant pictures for the site is also easily mendable with the proper material provided by our client. The issue here is that our client has not started his business yet and does not have the material to provide the pictures. To mend the issue of big images in the portfolio, it is possible to scroll them horizontally or to size them smaller.

            Some of our testers also mentioned that there was a need for a store on the site. The issue here is that our client did not have the pricing of the product at hand. This is first and foremost the beginning of his drone business, and therefore impossible to implement at this time.

            The site should be optimised for viewing on different screen sizes and aspect ratios. At the moment it doesn’t display well on many phones.

            <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        </header>

        <p>
            We have learned that good code takes time. It is therefore important to plan ahead in good time and coordinate with others in the group. It is also easy to imagine a great design and sketch a draft, but it might not be that easy to execute.

            Another aspect is that what looks good on the drawing board, might not look good or be user friendly when put into life. We have had some struggles with getting the menus to work well with the video in the background. We love the feel of the video - it is really captivating when opening the website. But as the video has different colors, both dark and light colors, it has been a real challenge to make it work. We wanted to avoid a “menu bar” spanning across the top as we think it’s not as pretty, but it might be easier for user to navigate with.

            The planning made in “P2” was also helpful to get a sense of what we were going to make in the final assignment. We had valuable time with the client to discuss what the site was going to “be” and what he wanted from it. That was time well spent.
