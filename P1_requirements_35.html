      <h2>Our client</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Our client is Kjell-Inge Johansen. He is a friend of Ingvild in the group, and they met playing the Ingress mobile
      game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kjell-Inge is a truck driver, with a growing side business shooting drone footage. He would like a webpage to
      display his cinematic drone videos and images, but also to get more drone shoot commissions.
    </p>

      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>

      <p>
        The goal of the webpage is to create a platform for Kjell-Inge to display demo videos and images from his
        drones,
        and to spark interest with potential clients.
      </p>

      <p>
        He himself describes it as he can sell images/videos of anything that can be captured from the air. He lists:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sports events and other happenings</li>
        <li>Roof inspections</li>
        <li>House/properties</li>
        <li>Cars and boats</li>
        <li>Aid in searches for escaped cows, sheep and other animals that a farmer wants to get inside for the winter
          (not accidents/collisions with animals and wildlife)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        People have searched for days for a lost cow or sheep in the mountains without finding it. I took 3
        minutes to find 10 cows the last time.
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      As Kjell-Inge is a seasonal truck driver, he has half a year off from his truck driving job and a lot of time on
      his
      hands that he wants to use for something useful. His drone side business is for the most part a hobby of his, but
      he
      would like enough commissions to enable him to keep the hobby going and to finance itself. We will provide contact
      information for potential clients, and include prices for the different services he can offer.

      <h2>Audience</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      The audience will mainly be potential clients of Kjell-Inge. What the clients have in common is that they all want
      a
      drone shoot - but they might want it for different reasons. His ideal commissions are simpler and shorter
      commissions over the maximum of a couple of days.
    </p>

    <p>
      One identified client group are people who want to capture an event. It could be sports events and the like. An
      example is when Kjell-Inge filmed the Norwegian indoor archery and outdoor 3d archery championships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another is people who want to sell a property/house, a car or boat. Or they might want a spectacular shoot of
      their
      boat. Others might need help inspecting a roof for damages after a storm.
    </p>

    <p>
      A third group is people who want aid in searches. In many parts of Norway cows, sheep and other livestock roam
      freely in the mountains during summer. A farmer might then have a challenge finding all his animals, and getting
      them back to the farm before the winter sets in. Kjell-Inge can save farmers valuable time by locating the animals
      in a much shorter time frame than if they had to look for the drone without drone assistance.
