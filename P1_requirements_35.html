      <h2>Administrative details</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Our client is Kjell-Inge Johansen. He is a friend of Ingvild in the group, and they met playing the Ingress mobile
      game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kjell-Inge is a truck driver, with a growing side business shooting drone footage. He would like a webpage to
      display his cinematic drone videos and images, but also to get more drone shoot commissions.
    </p>
  </section>

      <h2>Purpose and Goals</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      Kjell-Inge is a seasonal truck driver. He drives a truck for half of the year, then he has half a year off. 
      Having a lot of time on his hands during his free period, and wanting to use his time for something useful, he has taken up drone photography. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Today Kjell-Inge uses social media to share his photography. In parallel to his hobby growing a need for his own web based platform has surfaced. 
      Thus, one of the main goals with the site is to display his videos and photography in a beautiful and captivating way. 
      We want to visually demonstrate his photography skills, and show the audience some of the many things that can be photographed from the air via drones. 
    </p>

    <p>
      For the most part drone photography is a hobby of Kjell-Inge’s. 
      But as he has been getting drone photography commissions now and then, he would like the website to facilitate more customers. 
      Getting more commissions would enable him to keep his hobby going and finance itself. 
    </p>

    <p>
      A portfolio displaying some demo videos and photography from his drones can spark interest with potential customers. 
      From there it should be easy for potential customers to take action and book Kjell-Inge for their drone photography needs. 
      The website should therefore have his contact information and a contact form. 
      We will also include a section listing the different services that can be booked, including prices. 
      Potential customers should be able to get a clear picture of what he can offer with ease.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some customers might also be curious about the kind of drone and camera equipment that Kjell-Inge uses, 
      so we are also considering including a page where this is presented.
    </p>
  </section>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      The website’s audience will mainly be potential customers of Kjell-Inge. 
      What they all have in common is that they all want a photograph or video of something from the air - but they might want it for different reasons. 
    </p>

    <p>
      His ideal commissions are simple and short commissions over the maximum of a couple of days. 
      Thus, we will not be targeting audiences that want bigger drone commissions over several days or weeks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kjell-Inge himself says that he can sell videos and pictures of anything that can be captured from the air. 
      Through talks with Kjell-Inge we have defined three target subgroups:
    </p>
    
    <h3>1. Sports events and other happenings</h3>
    
    <p>
      The first identified target group are customers who want to capture sport events and other types of happenings.
      An example of this is when Kjell-Inge filmed the Norwegian indoor archery and outdoor 3d archery championships.
    </p>

    <p>
      This subgroup could be expanded to other types of sports or happenings when people gather outside,
      or inside if the location is suited for drone flying.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The site should therefore have a profile that suits this active and upbeat target group.
    </p>
    
    <h3>2. Houses, boats, cars and other things</h3>
      
    <p>
      Many things will look great when photographed from the air.
      Some customers might want a spectacular shoot of their beloved car or boat, which Kjell-Inge can help them with.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some customers might want a drone shoot for selling purposes, that being of their property, car, boat or other things.
      More and more people opt for selling their property themselves rather than using a real estate agent, but they might not own the proper equipment for a drone shoot.
      For this group it is especially important to display some imagery that corresponds with the group’s needs -
      showing them examples of other customers using Kjell-Inge’s services for selling houses and alike.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Others might need help inspecting their property for damages after bad weather.
      Kjell-Inge lives in Møre og Romsdal county, with periodically harsh weather conditions.
      Winds storming across the lands often cause damage to roofs and other parts of buildings, and it can be tricky to climb a ladder and inspect the damages.
      Kjell-Inge can help them canvas the extent of the damages from the air.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Searches for lost farm animals and pets</h3>
    
    <p>
      A third target group is people who want aid in searches for escaped and lost animals.
      In many parts of Norway cows, sheep and other livestock roam freely in the mountains during summer.
      A farmer will often have a challenge locating all his animals when he needs to get them back to the farm before the winter sets in.
      Kjell-Inge can save a farmer’s valuable time by locating the livestock in a much shorter time frame than if they had to look for them without drone assistance.
      As Kjell-Inge puts it:
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
      People have searched for days for a lost cow or sheep in the mountains without finding it. I took 3 minutes to find 10 cows the last time I did it.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
      Kjell-Inge has made it clear he does not want to do accidents/collisions photography involving animals and wildlife.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We will also keep this target subgroup in mind when working on the website, and creating a site that suits farmers and other animal owners needs and preferences.

      <h2>Content of the site and how it is organized</h2>
    </header>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Frontpage:
        The website should have a beautiful and inviting frontpage that quickly communicates what the site is about. 
        People should not have to search long to find out what kind of website they have stumbled upon or how they can navigate. 
        The front page will include a taste of the photography that can further be explored in the portfolio.
      </li>
        
      <li>
        About Johansen luftfoto:
        A short introduction to Kjell-Inge Johansen. 
        We want to add some personality to it in order for people to get to know Kjell-Inge some more, and give people an impression of who he is as a person. 
        We will also include some information about his experience and background in photography, and how his drone photography came to life. 
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Portfolio:
        Kjell-Inge’s portfolio will be one of the most important sections. 
        Our challenge will be to display a great selection of photography without the site taking too long to load. 
        The portfolio should suit all his target audience groups:
        <ol>
          <li>Events - Sports competitions, other happenings</li>
          <li>Things - Cars and boats, properties, damage inspections</li>
          <li>Searches - Lost livestock and pets</li>
        </ol>
        The users should not have to use a lot of time or get lost navigating between many kinds of subcategories to find what they want. 
        This is another challenge we have to solve - creating a portfolio that serves all audience subgroups without being too messy or overcomplicated.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Services and prices:
        Here the users can find the different types of services they can book Kjell-Inge for. 
        Users can differentiate between commissions on an hourly or up to two-day-basis, whether they want videos or photographs, and so on. 
        Users will also be informed about how the final product will be delivered and in what format. 
        This site poses another challenge for us to solve, namely how to give the customers the information they need; 
        either through a list, table or calculator, without bombarding them with too much information that they don’t need.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Terms of services:
        his page will have some information about the rules and regulations for drone photography, 
        and what customers might need to keep in mind when booking drone photography. 
        It will also include customer rights, such as whether they have a right for a refund if the weather is too bad for filming and so on.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Drones and cameras:
        This section will be used to present Kjell-Inge’s camera and drone equipment. 
        Customers who are particularly interested in details about this will find it here. 
        It should include both images of his equipment, and technical details.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Contact:
        This section will let users contact Kjell-Inge for booking purposes through a contact form. 
        The form should be easy to use, and not ask for more user information than necessary. 
        We will also include contact information for customers to contact Kjell-Inge directly and not through the form.
      </li>
    </ol>
